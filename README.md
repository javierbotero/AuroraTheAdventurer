# Aurora The Adventurer #

Aurora the adventurer is a little girl that likes nature and explore it. Aurora will have to collect all garbage that finds on the way to the indigenous tribe, but she must be careful with the jungle because any beast can bit her and make her lose her path. This game is developed using Phaser and Webpack, with the help of ES6 modules syntax and organization. The project is being built, so some links are just placeholders.
